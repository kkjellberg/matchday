# Matchday Manager

Matchday Manager is an app I've created to help soccer coaches with some of their basic needs on a matchday.

## Usage

Here are the 3 main functions of the app:

1. You can utilize the 'Teamsheet' page to create save, and send your starting lineup to all of your players.
2. You can head over to the 'Match Report' page to provide your own in depth look at a match that was played. Fill in the result and include any notes you had about the match, then save the report to your 'Match Archive'.
3. And finally the 'Match Archive' page. Here you can view all of your created match reports. Viewing previous match reports can provide coaches with an easy-to-access outlook on where their team is strong, or where they are struggling to peform. Viewing a report of a previously played match against an upcoming opponent can aid in a coaches strategic planning and decision making on the next matchday.
